# 🧪 25+ Mini Frontend Projects – JD's Learning Lab

> **A curated collection of mini-projects built using HTML, CSS, Vanilla JavaScript, and TailwindCSS.**

Welcome to my frontend playground! This project is a personal archive of 25+ mini-projects I built during my learning journey as a frontend developer. Each project helped me understand concepts like layout, interactivity, animations, and component design.

These mini-projects may not be perfect — some are raw, others more refined — but each represents a milestone in my web development journey.

## 💡 Purpose

This is not a polished component library or design system. It’s a reflection of:

- 💻 My learning progress
- 🧠 Conceptual understanding through experimentation
- 🛠️ Hands-on practice in real HTML, CSS, JS & Tailwind
- 🧩 Building confidence with small, testable ideas before larger projects

---

## 📌 Tech Stack

- **HTML5**
- **CSS3**
- **JavaScript (Vanilla)**
- **TailwindCSS**
- **CodePen** (for hosting code demos)

---

## 🧠 What I Learned

- DOM Manipulation
- Responsive Layouts with Flex & Grid
- CSS Animations & Transitions
- Data-driven Components
- Event Handling & UI State
- Tailwind Utility-First CSS
